# 2026-World-Cup-Simulation
This project uses supervised machine learning to simulate and predict outcomes for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The goal is to create a data-driven model that can forecast match results and tournament progression based on historical performance and team statistics. This simulation starts from the qualification round and simulates the tournament 10,000 times to give percentages of times teams win in those simulations.
